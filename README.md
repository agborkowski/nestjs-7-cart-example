nestjs v7 cart example

# Description
Basic proof of concept for shopping cart. Tests are focused on `Cart` service, e2e endpoints are documented in [Postman](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/4765760/Szf53p7o?version=latest)

There is many possibility improvements like, better validation, split cart and item services etc..

Its easy to add nest.js modules for swagger documentation, and simple Logger but i skip it.

run test by `yarn test` :)
